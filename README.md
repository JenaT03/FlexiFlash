<h1> FlexiFlash âœ¨</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>According to various studies, images are processed by the brain faster and help stimulate multiple senses, enhancing memory retention. Therefore, the FlexiFlash application is designed to integrate images into each flashcard, optimizing the learning and memorization process. 
</p>

<p>FlexiFlash allows users to freely create and customize their own flashcard sets. The application provides features that enable users to describe each flashcard in detail and read the content aloud, making learning more engaging and flexible. With FlexiFlash, studying becomes easier and more effective than ever, helping users grasp knowledge and retain information longer. 
</p>

<p> This project is a collaborative effort between me and my classmate- Le Truong Ngoc Duyen, aiming to build an effective and user-friendly flashcard application.</p>
